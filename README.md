# Budget-Calcuator

### DevOps Core Fundamental Project - Author Harry Johnson

#### Objective
To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

To meet all the goals/objectives I will need to
* Create a Kanban board to provide clear project mangement
* Have a relational database in which there are a minimum of 2 tables with a relationship between them
* Clear Documents to go along with the programming hosted here on the readme page
* A Functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application coded in python as set out in my epic on my board
* Well designed tests that cover my programming as much as possible
* A frontend website build with python and html
* Code which uses a version control system 

#### Project Overview
I want to create an app that is a Budget Calculator.I want to have lots of users which are able to create multiple
budgets which in turn will have multiple items attached to it. Users will be able to input and view their username email and annual salary, User will also be able to create and view budgets which will have relationships with both users and task, budgets will also have a name and a max spending amount. Items will be part of budgets and will have names, descriptions, amounts and you will also be able to see how much of the max budget they are. 

All tables (Users, Budgets and items) should have full CRUD functionailty
